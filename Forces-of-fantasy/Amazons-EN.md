# amazons

Amazons are unique in that their race has no males—reproduction takes place by parthenogenic reaction controlled by drugs. When the Slann ruled the world, Amazons were created to undertake many mundane tasks and labor. When the warp-gates collapsed, the Amazons already shared the high civilization of the Slann, serving as technicians and helpmates. As a result, their history has been one of slow degeneration under the shadow of the Slann's heritage, preserving many of the higher sciences lost to the Slann themselves.

- Skirmisher (if on foot only)
- Rallying Cry
- Matriarch Authority (Mother of Sisterhood only)
- Ancient Wisdom (Mother of Sisterhood only)

**Matriarch Authority** (Mother of Sisterhood only)

The Mother of Sisterhood represents the supreme authority within the Amazon hierarchy. Her command is absolute and her presence on the battlefield inspires her sisters to accomplish greater martial feats.

Amazon Core units (Tribal Warriors, Anakonda Warriors, Totem Warriors, and Eagle Warriors) within 12" of one or more friendly models with this rule may use this model's Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.

Once per battle, at the start of any phase during the Amazon player's turn, a model with this rule may declare a Sister's Command. Until the end of that turn, all Amazon units within 18" of the model that declared the Sister's Command gain +1 to their Combat Resolution.

**Ancient Wisdom** (Mother of Sisterhood only)

Mothers of Sisterhood have preserved fragments of Slann knowledge concerning warfare and tactics, allowing them to outmaneuver their adversaries.

If your army includes at least one model with this rule, you may re-roll one dice when determining deployment zones.

If the General of your army has this rule, you may deploy one Core unit after the enemy has finished their deployment (but before Scouts).

Ancient Wisdom unlocks: Slann Star-Fire Cannon

**War Cry** (Amazon War Leader only)

At the start of any friendly turn, an Amazon War Leader may trigger a War Cry. All friendly Amazon Core units within 6" may immediately re-roll failed Leadership tests until the start of the next friendly turn. If the War Leader is the army's Battle Standard Bearer, the range is increased to 12".

## HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE SERPENT / SERPENT PRIESTESS

| | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Points |
|---|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| High Priestess of the Serpent | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 8 | 160 |

**Troop Type:** Regular infantry (character)

**Base Size:** 25 x 25 mm

**Unit Size:** 1

**Equipment**
- Hand weapon

**Magic**
A High Priestess of the Serpent is a Level 3 Wizard. A Serpent Priestess is a Level 1 Wizard.

Every Priestess knows spells from one of the following Lores of Magic:
- Lore of Beasts
- Lore of Life
- Lore of Serpents

**Options**
**Mounts:**
- May be mounted ......................................................................................... See page XX

**A High Priestess of the Serpent may:**
- Be a Level 4 Wizard ............................................................................................... +35 points

- Rallying Cry

**Ritual of the Scaled Servants** (High Priestess of the Serpent Level 3 or 4 only)

The highest rank among the Serpent Priestesses, a High Priestess has mastered not only the magical arts of the Lore of Lustria but also the ancient rituals recorded on Slann stone tablets hidden deep within the ruins of temples. These forbidden rites allow her to awaken and command the great beasts that once served the Old Ones as guardians and war machines.

If your army includes a High Priestess of the Serpent with this option, you may include the following units in your army:

**Special Choices:**
- 0-2 units of Amazon Cold One Riders (in addition to those already permitted)
- 0-1 unit of Amazon Terradon Riders

**Rare Choices:**
- 0-1 War Stegadon of the Ancients

These units count as Amazon units for all purposes and gain the Native of Lustria special rule. However, they do not gain the Cold-Blooded special rule (they are commanded by the Priestess's will, not naturally disciplined like true Lizardmen creatures).

**Restriction:** If the High Priestess of the Serpent is slain during the battle, all units unlocked by this rule must immediately take a Leadership test at the start of each subsequent friendly turn. If failed, the unit becomes subject to Stupidity for the rest of the game, as the Priestess's control over the creatures weakens.

## Koka-Kalim Warriors

The Koka-Kalim are the fanatical elite of Amazonian warriors, a militant order tasked with protecting the temples and sanctuaries of the goddess Rigg. Their name derives from their constant consumption of koka, a narcotic drug extracted from local plants that allows them to go almost entirely without sleep or food. This dependency gives them an emaciated appearance and a disturbed gaze, but also exceptional martial capabilities. Impervious to pain and devoid of any natural aversion to blood and death, these fighters exist in a permanent state of nervous agitation that makes them unpredictable and irrational. The Sisterhood, holder of religious power in Amazonia, maintains an elite guard of Koka-Kalim called the Devouts, who protect the most sacred sanctuaries and are sometimes entrusted with ancestral Slann weapons: power swords and bolter guns, relics venerated as gifts from Rigg herself.


|                  | M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | points |
|------------------|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|----|--------|

* **Immune to Psychology**
* **Impetuous**
* **Native of Lustria** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Sacred Fury (see below)**
* **Unbreakable**

**Sacred Fury**

Warriors who have undergone the Koka-Kalim ritual and constantly consume the narcotic drug feel reduced pain and fight with supernatural vigor in close combat. Deprived of their normal sensory functions by the effects of koka, they can overcome great suffering and have no aversion to death, continuing to fight despite wounds that would fell ordinary warriors.

A model with this special rule has:
- A 6+ Ward save against any wounds suffered that were caused by a non-magical enemy attack.
- A 5+ Ward save against any wounds suffered that were caused by a non-magical enemy attack with a Strength 5 or higher.

**Fighting Platform**

The Stegadon's howdah serves as a mobile fighting platform for Amazon warriors. The crew may shoot their bows or javelins in the Shooting phase, targeting any enemy unit within range and line of sight.

**Shooting Profile (Fighting Platform)**

**Bows:**

| Range | Strength | AP | Special Rules |
|-------|----------|----|---------------|
| 24"   | 3        | -  | Volley Fire   |

**Javelins:**

| Range | Strength | AP | Special Rules     |
|-------|----------|----|-------------------|
| 8"    | 3        | -  | Poisoned Attacks  |

The Amazon Crew fires with BS 3 and may shoot 360° (the howdah allows firing in all directions).


** Slann Star-Fire Cannon Platform** (Requires Mother of Sisterhood)

An Ancient Stegadon may replace its standard Fighting Platform with a Slann Star-Fire Cannon mounted upon its howdah. This ancient relic of the Old Ones has been adapted by the Mothers of Sisterhood to be carried into battle atop these massive beasts, combining devastating firepower with battlefield mobility.

 Mounted Star-Fire Configuration

When a Slann Star-Fire Cannon is mounted on an Ancient Stegadon:

- The Amazon Crew is reduced to **3 crew members** (instead of 5) who operate the cannon
- The crew **loses** their bows and javelins (they operate the cannon instead)
- The Ancient Stegadon **may move and fire** the Star-Fire Cannon in the same turn (ignoring the normal Move or Fire restriction)
- The cannon uses the crew's **BS 3** to hit
- The cannon retains all other special rules: **Anti-Gravity Weapon, Catastrophic Overload**
- The cannon has the same profile as the standard Slann Star-Fire Cannon (see Slann Star-Fire Cannon entry)

Shooting Profile (Star-Fire Cannon Platform)

**Range:** 36"

**Strength:** 7

**Special Rules:** Armour Piercing (3), Magical Attacks, Multiple Wounds (D3), Anti-Gravity Weapon

**Anti-Gravity Weapon:**
- Against models with Toughness 5 or higher, the cannon's Strength counts as **Strength 8**
- Against models with 3 or more Wounds on their profile, the Multiple Wounds effect increases to **(D3+1)**
- Against War Machines, Stone Throwers, Chariots, and Monsters, successful hits wound automatically (still apply Armour Piercing 3)

The cannon may fire 360° from the howdah platform.

Catastrophic Overload (Mounted)

If the Ancient Stegadon is reduced to 0 Wounds and has a mounted Slann Star-Fire Cannon, roll a D6:

- **1-2:** **Gravitational Implosion** - All models (friend and foe) within 3D6" must take a Leadership test. If failed, they are pulled D3" directly towards the Stegadon's position. All models within 6" suffer a Strength 6 hit with Armour Piercing (2) and Multiple Wounds (D3).
- **3-4:** **Controlled Shutdown** - The ancient safety protocols activate. No additional effects.
- **5-6:** **Crystal Fragmentation** - All models (friend and foe) within 6" suffer a Strength 5 hit.

Restrictions

- **Requires Mother of Sisterhood:** The Slann Star-Fire Cannon (mounted or otherwise) may only be included in an army that contains at least one Mother of Sisterhood
- This option counts toward your army's 0-1 Slann Star-Fire Cannon limitation
- If you take a mounted Star-Fire Cannon, you cannot also take a static Star-Fire Cannon (and vice versa)
- Only **Ancient Stegadons** may be equipped with the Star-Fire Cannon Platform (regular Stegadons cannot)




**Great Horns**

| Range  | Strength | AP  | Special Rules |
|--------|----------|-----|---------------|
| Combat | User     | -3  | -             |



**Character Mount**

A Stegadon or Ancient Stegadon may be included in your army as a character mount for an Amazon Hero or Mother of Sisterhood. Its cost is added to that of its rider.

Note that, because it has the Howdah special rule, a Stegadon or Ancient Stegadon is considered a chariot rather than a mounted monster.

When taken as a character mount:
- The character replaces one of the Amazon Crew members
- The character may fight in close combat and shoot with the platform's weapons (or operate the Star-Fire Cannon if equipped)
- The character benefits from the howdah's protection

# Amazons special rules


### Blades of the Ancients
*These weapons, remnants of a forgotten era, are technological artefacts of unknown origin—rumoured to be much sought-after High Age relics. The gems set within the hilt blaze with the captive fires of a falling star, offering both protection and offensive power.*

In **The Old World**, the *Blades of the Ancients* count as both a melee weapon and a missile weapon with the following profile:

**Weapon Profile: Blade of the Ancients**

| Weapon | Range | S | AP | Special Rules |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Melee** | Combat | S+1 | -1 | Magical Attacks, Force Field, Requires Two Hands* |
| **Shooting (Sunfire)** | 12" | 3 | - | Magical Attacks, Quick Shot, Solar Sight |

**Weapon Special Rules:**

*   **Force Field:** A model equipped with this weapon has a **6+ Ward Save** against wounds suffered during any phase.
*   **Solar Sight:** When this weapon is used during the Shooting phase, the wielder ignores To Hit modifiers for **Long Range** and **Cover** (partial or full).
*   **Quick Shot:** The wielder does not suffer the usual -1 To Hit penalty for Moving and Shooting.


---

### Native of Lustria
*The Amazons are born into the green hell of Lustria. Where others see impenetrable terrain and death, they see a home.*

**Unit Special Rule:**

Models with this special rule are subject to the following effects:

*   **Move Through Cover:** Models with this rule do not roll **Dangerous Terrain** tests when moving through terrain features classified as Forest, Jungle, Marsh, or Water.
*   **Natural Camouflage:** If the unit is predominantly within a Forest or Jungle terrain feature, enemies suffer an additional -1 modifier when rolling To Hit against them during the Shooting phase (this stacks with the usual Cover modifiers).
*   **Jungle Stalkers:** When determining who takes the First Turn or choosing deployment zones in a scenario set in a Jungle/Lustria biome (or using specific Lustria rules), the Amazons gain +1 to their roll.


# Lore of the Serpent

"In the depths of the jungle, where sunlight barely penetrates the canopy and ancient ruins whisper of forgotten ages, the Serpent Priestesses commune with powers older than the Old Ones themselves. Theirs is not the crude magic of beast-tamers or the calculated sorcery of the Slann, but something primal and deadly - the magic of venom and fang, of coils that crush and eyes that mesmerize. They are the bridge between the civilized Amazons and the savage jungle, channeling the predatory essence of the great serpents that ruled these lands before even the Amazons' arrival."
"To learn the Lore of the Serpent is to embrace transformation - not merely of flesh, but of spirit. The Priestesses shed their human frailty as a serpent sheds its skin, becoming vessels for an ancient, reptilian consciousness. Their magic does not conquer nature; it becomes nature, adopting the patience of the python, the speed of the viper, and the inevitability of venom coursing through veins."
— Teachings of the First Coil, Serpent Priestess Codex

**Type:** Summoning  
**Casting Value:** 10+
