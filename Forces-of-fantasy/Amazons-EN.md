# amazons

Amazons are unique in that their race has no males—reproduction takes place by parthenogenic reaction controlled by drugs. When the Slann ruled the world, Amazons were created to undertake many mundane tasks and labor. When the warp-gates collapsed, the Amazons already shared the high civilization of the Slann, serving as technicians and helpmates. As a result, their history has been one of slow degeneration under the shadow of the Slann's heritage, preserving many of the higher sciences lost to the Slann themselves.

# Mother of Sisterhood

## Background

The Mothers of Sisterhood are the matriarchs and military leaders of the Amazon tribes of Lustria. Direct heirs to Slann knowledge, they are commanders, guardians of ancestral traditions, and spiritual figures of their people. Each Mother oversees a tribe or group of related tribes, maintaining social order and perpetuating the parthenogenic reproduction rituals that ensure their race's survival.

Unlike Serpent Priestesses who channel magical energies, Mothers of Sisterhood excel in the art of war and tactical command. They carry the most ancient Blades of the Ancients, Slann artefacts passed down through generations, and are often accompanied by totem animals symbolizing their authority.

## Special Rules

* **Inspiring Presence**
* **Native of Lustria** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Skirmisher** (if on foot only)
* **Matriarch Authority**
* **Ancient Wisdom**

### Matriarch Authority

The Mother of Sisterhood represents supreme authority in the Amazon hierarchy. Her command is absolute and her presence on the battlefield inspires her sisters to greater feats of martial prowess.

Amazon Core units (Tribal Warriors, Anakonda Warriors, and Humming Bird Warriors) within 12" of one or more friendly models with this special rule may use that model's Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.

Once per battle, at the start of any phase during the Amazon player's turn, a model with this special rule may declare a **Sister's Command**. Until the end of that turn, all Amazon units within 18" of the model that declared the Sister's Command gain +1 to their Combat Resolution.

### Ancient Wisdom

Mothers of Sisterhood have preserved fragments of Slann knowledge concerning warfare and tactics, allowing them to outmaneuver their foes through superior strategic insight.

If your army includes at least one model with this special rule, you may re-roll a single dice when rolling to determine who chooses deployment zones.

In addition, if your army's General has this special rule, you may deploy one Core unit after the enemy has finished deploying their army (but before Scouts are deployed).

# Koka-Kalim Warriors

## Background

The Koka-Kalim are the most feared warriors among the Amazon tribes. These warriors have undergone the sacred Koka-Kalim ritual, a transformation process that strips away their sense of self-preservation and amplifies their combat prowess. Through ancient Slann techniques preserved by the Serpent Priestesses, their bodies are conditioned to ignore pain and fight beyond normal physical limitations.

Armed with the revered Blades of the Ancients, these warriors form the shock troops of Amazon armies. They advance with inexorable determination, their eyes fixed on the enemy, utterly heedless of danger. Their presence on the battlefield is both inspiring and terrifying – to allies, they represent the ultimate dedication to the tribe's survival; to enemies, they are an unstoppable tide of obsidian blades and savage fury.

The ritual that creates a Koka-Kalim warrior is irreversible. Once undertaken, these warriors can never return to normal tribal life. They live in sacred groves near the temples, tended by the Serpent Priestesses and called upon only in times of great need. Their sacrifice is honored by all Amazons, for they have given up their individual existence to become living weapons in defense of their people.

* **Immune to Psychology**
* **Impetuous**
* **Native of Lustria** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Sacred Fury**
* **Unbreakable**

### Sacred Fury

Warriors who have undergone the Koka-Kalim ritual feel reduced pain and fight with supernatural vigor in close combat. The ritual has fundamentally altered their physiology, allowing them to fight on through wounds that would fell ordinary warriors.

Models with this special rule have a 6+ Ward save against wounds suffered in close combat only.

In addition, at the start of each Round of Combat after the first (i.e., from Round 2 onwards), roll a D6 for each model with this special rule that has previously suffered one or more unsaved Wounds during this combat. On a roll of 6, that model immediately recovers 1 Wound previously lost during this combat (to a maximum of its starting Wound characteristic).

**Designer's Note:** This represents the Koka-Kalim's ability to fight through injuries and their enhanced recovery in the heat of battle, but does not protect them from ranged attacks or magic where they are as vulnerable as any other warrior.

### Standard Equipment

* Hand weapon
* **Blade of the Ancients**
* Light armour

## Unit Composition & Options

### Options

* The entire unit may be equipped with **javelins** at an additional cost of +1 point per model

## amazons Magic Items

The pages that follow detail magic items unique to Lizardmen armies. These can be purchased by models within a Lizardmen army in exactly the same way as Common magic items, as described in the Warhammer: the Old World rulebook.

Extremely Common Magic Items: Any magic item marked with an asterisk (*) is considered to be extremely common, as described in the Warhammer: the Old World rulebook.

## Amazons special rules


**Blades of the ancients** : The Amazons carry a special kind of weapon of unknown origin, wich they call the Blades of the Ancients. These weapons are rumoured to be rare and mush sought after High Age artefacts. Despite their vast age they are still powerful, the gems set within them said blaze with the captures fires of a falling star.

The blades give the amazons +1 Strength in close combat. Furthermore, they projects a shield or arcane energy around the wearer, granting her a 6+ Ward save.

In addition the Amazons can point the baldes at the enemy and unleash the very flames of the sun itself in the shooting phase. This grants each Amazon a missile attack with a range of 12'' wich causes a Strength 3 hit, No penalities from range  or movement apply whene the amazons use this attack.

**skirmishers** : Amazons are well accustomed to jungle warfare and as such they are regarded as skirmishers. Should they required to rank un in order to fight in a melee. (Anakonda, Humming Bird,and Pirrana must be positioned in the front of rank)

**Native of Lustria** : The Amazons are native of Lustria and jungle hold no peril for them. When using the jungle rules (like WFB6 Warhamer Realms: Lustria ) they are immune to the same Encounters as the Lizardmen.
