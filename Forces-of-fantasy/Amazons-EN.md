# amazons

Amazons are unique in that their race has no males—reproduction takes place by parthenogenic reaction controlled by drugs. When the Slann ruled the world, Amazons were created to undertake many mundane tasks and labor. When the warp-gates collapsed, the Amazons already shared the high civilization of the Slann, serving as technicians and helpmates. As a result, their history has been one of slow degeneration under the shadow of the Slann's heritage, preserving many of the higher sciences lost to the Slann themselves.

# Mother of Sisterhood

## Background

The Mothers of Sisterhood are the matriarchs and military leaders of the Amazon tribes of Lustria. Direct heirs to Slann knowledge, they are commanders, guardians of ancestral traditions, and spiritual figures of their people. Each Mother oversees a tribe or group of related tribes, maintaining social order and perpetuating the parthenogenic reproduction rituals that ensure their race's survival.

Unlike Serpent Priestesses who channel magical energies, Mothers of Sisterhood excel in the art of war and tactical command. They carry the most ancient Blades of the Ancients, Slann artefacts passed down through generations, and are often accompanied by totem animals symbolizing their authority.

|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|----|--------|
| 4 | 5  | 4  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 9  | 85     |

**Troop Type:** Infantry (Hero)
**Base Size:** 25 x 25 mm
**Unit Size:** 1
## Equipment
* Hand weapon
* Blade of the Ancients
* Light armour

## Special Rules

* **Blades of the Ancients** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Inspiring Presence**
* **Native of Lustria** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Skirmisher** (if on foot only)
* **Matriarch Authority**
* **Ancient Wisdom**

### Matriarch Authority

The Mother of Sisterhood represents supreme authority in the Amazon hierarchy. Her command is absolute and her presence on the battlefield inspires her sisters to greater feats of martial prowess.

Amazon Core units (Tribal Warriors, Anakonda Warriors, Totem Warriors, and Eagle Warriors) within 12" of one or more friendly models with this special rule may use that model's Leadership characteristic when taking Leadership tests.

Once per battle, at the start of any phase during the Amazon player's turn, a model with this special rule may declare a **Sister's Command**. Until the end of that turn, all Amazon units within 18" of the model that declared the Sister's Command gain +1 to their Combat Resolution.

### Ancient Wisdom

Mothers of Sisterhood have preserved fragments of Slann knowledge concerning warfare and tactics, allowing them to outmaneuver their foes through superior strategic insight.

If your army includes at least one model with this special rule, you may re-roll a single dice when rolling to determine who chooses deployment zones.

In addition, if your army's General has this special rule, you may deploy one Core unit after the enemy has finished deploying their army (but before Scouts are deployed).

Finally, Ancient Wisdom grants access to some technologies of the ancient Slann, technologies that no one in the Old World can claim to possess. These technologies seem to come from another era or another world. Ancient Wisdom unlocks: Slann Star-Fire Cannon

## Updated Serpent Priestess Entry

### Serpent Priestess - Wizard Level 1-4

**Special Rules:**
- Blades of the Ancients
- Native of Lustria
- Lore of Lustria (Wizards only)


**Magic:**
A Serpent Priestess is a Level 1 Wizard who uses spells from the Lore of Lustria.

A Serpent Priestess may be upgraded to:
- Wizard Level 2 for +35 points
- Wizard Level 3 for +70 points  
- Wizard Level 4 for +105 points

A Wizard Level 4 Serpent Priestess may be upgraded to a **High Priestess of the Serpent** (see below).

**Lores of Magic:**
Every Serpent Priestess knows spells from one of the following Lores of Magic:
- Lore of Beasts
- Lore of Life
- Lore of Serpents


### High Priestess of the Serpent - +50 points

**Requirements:**
- Only available to a Serpent Priestess (Hero) at Wizard Level 4
- Must be included in a 2000+ point army

**Magic:**
A High Priestess of the Serpent is a Level 4 Wizard who uses spells from the Lore of Lustria.

**Lores of Magic:**
Every High Priestess of the Serpent knows spells from one of the following Lores of Magic:
- Lore of Beasts
- Lore of Life
- Lore of Serpents

**Background:**

The highest rank among the Serpent Priestesses, a High Priestess has mastered not only the magical arts of the Lore of Lustria but also the ancient rituals recorded on Slann stone tablets hidden deep within the temple ruins. These forbidden rites allow her to awaken and command the great beasts that once served the Old Ones as guardians and war-engines.

Through days of chanting and ritual preparation, a High Priestess can perform the **Ritual of the Scaled Servants**, calling forth the descendants of creatures that remember the time when the Slann ruled Lustria. These ancient beasts recognize the authority carried in the Priestess's words and temporarily submit to the Amazon warband, seeing in them echoes of their former masters.

However, this power comes at great cost. The ritual drains the Priestess's spiritual energy and requires rare sacred herbs and offerings. For this reason, only the most desperate circumstances warrant summoning these primordial creatures to war.


### Special Rule: Ritual of the Scaled Servants

A High Priestess of the Serpent has performed the forbidden rituals to command the great scaled beasts that once served the Slann.

If your army includes a High Priestess of the Serpent, you may include the following units in your army:

**Special Choices:**
- **0-2 units of Amazon Cold One Riders** (in addition to any already allowed)
- **0-1 unit of Amazon Terradon Riders** (see new unit entry below)

**Rare Choices:**
- **0-1 War Stegadon of the Ancients** (see new unit entry below)

These units count as Amazon units for all purposes and gain the **Native of Lustria** special rule. However, they do **not** gain the **Cold-Blooded** special rule (they are commanded by the Priestess's will, not naturally disciplined like true Lizardmen beasts).

**Restriction:** If the High Priestess of the Serpent is slain during the battle, all units unlocked by this rule must immediately take a Leadership test at the start of each subsequent friendly turn. If failed, the unit becomes subject to **Stupidity** for the remainder of the game as the Priestess's control over the beasts weakens.

**Character Mounts**

A character that can be mounted may choose a mount from the following list. Some mounts are covered in detail on this page. Those that are not have their own dedicated entries later in this army list.

A General may be mounted on a:
 - Cold One ...............+18 points
 - Culchan ...............+18 points
 - Koalt ................ +210 pts

# Koka-Kalim Warriors

The Koka-Kalim are the fanatical elite of Amazonian warriors, a militant order tasked with protecting the temples and sanctuaries of the goddess Rigg. Their name derives from their constant consumption of koka, a narcotic drug extracted from local plants that allows them to go almost entirely without sleep or food. This dependency gives them an emaciated appearance and a disturbed gaze, but also exceptional martial capabilities. Impervious to pain and devoid of any natural aversion to blood and death, these fighters exist in a permanent state of nervous agitation that makes them unpredictable and irrational. The Sisterhood, holder of religious power in Amazonia, maintains an elite guard of Koka-Kalim called the Devouts, who protect the most sacred sanctuaries and are sometimes entrusted with ancestral Slann weapons: power swords and bolter guns, relics venerated as gifts from Rigg herself.

* **Immune to Psychology**
* **Impetuous**
* **Native of Lustria** (see Amazons Army Special Rules)
* **Sacred Fury (see below)**
* **Unbreakable**

**Sacred Fury**

Warriors who have undergone the Koka-Kalim ritual and constantly consume the narcotic drug feel reduced pain and fight with supernatural vigor in close combat. Deprived of their normal sensory functions by the effects of koka, they can overcome great suffering and have no aversion to death, continuing to fight despite wounds that would fell ordinary warriors.

A model with this special rule has:
- A 6+ Ward save against any wounds suffered that were caused by a non-magical enemy attack.
- A 5+ Ward save against any wounds suffered that were caused by a non-magical enemy attack with a Strength 5 or higher.

**Fighting Platform**

The Stegadon's howdah serves as a mobile fighting platform for Amazon warriors. The crew may shoot their bows or javelins in the Shooting phase, targeting any enemy unit within range and line of sight.

**Shooting Profile (Fighting Platform)**

**Bows:**

| Range | Strength | AP | Special Rules |
|-------|----------|----|---------------|
| 24"   | 3        | -  | Volley Fire   |

**Javelins:**

| Range | Strength | AP | Special Rules     |
|-------|----------|----|-------------------|
| 8"    | 3        | -  | Poisoned Attacks  |

The Amazon Crew fires with BS 3 and may shoot 360° (the howdah allows firing in all directions).


** Slann Star-Fire Cannon Platform** (Requires Mother of Sisterhood)

An Ancient Stegadon may replace its standard Fighting Platform with a Slann Star-Fire Cannon mounted upon its howdah. This ancient relic of the Old Ones has been adapted by the Mothers of Sisterhood to be carried into battle atop these massive beasts, combining devastating firepower with battlefield mobility.

 Mounted Star-Fire Configuration

When a Slann Star-Fire Cannon is mounted on an Ancient Stegadon:

- The Amazon Crew is reduced to **3 crew members** (instead of 5) who operate the cannon
- The crew **loses** their bows and javelins (they operate the cannon instead)
- The Ancient Stegadon **may move and fire** the Star-Fire Cannon in the same turn (ignoring the normal Move or Fire restriction)
- The cannon uses the crew's **BS 3** to hit
- The cannon retains all other special rules: **Anti-Gravity Weapon, Catastrophic Overload**
- The cannon has the same profile as the standard Slann Star-Fire Cannon (see Slann Star-Fire Cannon entry)

Shooting Profile (Star-Fire Cannon Platform)

**Range:** 36"

**Strength:** 7

**Special Rules:** Armour Piercing (3), Magical Attacks, Multiple Wounds (D3), Anti-Gravity Weapon

**Anti-Gravity Weapon:**
- Against models with Toughness 5 or higher, the cannon's Strength counts as **Strength 8**
- Against models with 3 or more Wounds on their profile, the Multiple Wounds effect increases to **(D3+1)**
- Against War Machines, Stone Throwers, Chariots, and Monsters, successful hits wound automatically (still apply Armour Piercing 3)

The cannon may fire 360° from the howdah platform.

Catastrophic Overload (Mounted)

If the Ancient Stegadon is reduced to 0 Wounds and has a mounted Slann Star-Fire Cannon, roll a D6:

- **1-2:** **Gravitational Implosion** - All models (friend and foe) within 3D6" must take a Leadership test. If failed, they are pulled D3" directly towards the Stegadon's position. All models within 6" suffer a Strength 6 hit with Armour Piercing (2) and Multiple Wounds (D3).
- **3-4:** **Controlled Shutdown** - The ancient safety protocols activate. No additional effects.
- **5-6:** **Crystal Fragmentation** - All models (friend and foe) within 6" suffer a Strength 5 hit.

Restrictions

- **Requires Mother of Sisterhood:** The Slann Star-Fire Cannon (mounted or otherwise) may only be included in an army that contains at least one Mother of Sisterhood
- This option counts toward your army's 0-1 Slann Star-Fire Cannon limitation
- If you take a mounted Star-Fire Cannon, you cannot also take a static Star-Fire Cannon (and vice versa)
- Only **Ancient Stegadons** may be equipped with the Star-Fire Cannon Platform (regular Stegadons cannot)




**Great Horns**

| Range  | Strength | AP  | Special Rules |
|--------|----------|-----|---------------|
| Combat | User     | -3  | -             |



**Character Mount**

A Stegadon or Ancient Stegadon may be included in your army as a character mount for an Amazon Hero or Mother of Sisterhood. Its cost is added to that of its rider.

Note that, because it has the Howdah special rule, a Stegadon or Ancient Stegadon is considered a chariot rather than a mounted monster.

When taken as a character mount:
- The character replaces one of the Amazon Crew members
- The character may fight in close combat and shoot with the platform's weapons (or operate the Star-Fire Cannon if equipped)
- The character benefits from the howdah's protection

## amazons Magic Items

The pages that follow detail magic items unique to Lizardmen armies. These can be purchased by models within a Lizardmen army in exactly the same way as Common magic items, as described in the Warhammer: the Old World rulebook.

Extremely Common Magic Items: Any magic item marked with an asterisk (*) is considered to be extremely common, as described in the Warhammer: the Old World rulebook.

## Amazons special rules


**Blades of the ancients** : The Amazons carry a special kind of weapon of unknown origin, wich they call the Blades of the Ancients. These weapons are rumoured to be rare and mush sought after High Age artefacts. Despite their vast age they are still powerful, the gems set within them said blaze with the captures fires of a falling star.

The blades give the amazons +1 Strength in close combat. Furthermore, they projects a shield or arcane energy around the wearer, granting her a 6+ Ward save.

In addition the Amazons can point the baldes at the enemy and unleash the very flames of the sun itself in the shooting phase. This grants each Amazon a missile attack with a range of 12'' wich causes a Strength 3 hit, No penalities from range  or movement apply whene the amazons use this attack.

**skirmishers** : Amazons are well accustomed to jungle warfare and as such they are regarded as skirmishers. Should they required to rank un in order to fight in a melee. (Anakonda, Humming Bird,and Pirrana must be positioned in the front of rank)

**Native of Lustria** : The Amazons are native of Lustria and jungle hold no peril for them. When using the jungle rules (like WFB6 Warhamer Realms: Lustria ) they are immune to the same Encounters as the Lizardmen.
