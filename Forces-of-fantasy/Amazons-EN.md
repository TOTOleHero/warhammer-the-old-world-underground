# amazons

Amazons are unique in that their race has no males—reproduction takes place by parthenogenic reaction controlled by drugs. When the Slann ruled the world, Amazons were created to undertake many mundane tasks and labor. When the warp-gates collapsed, the Amazons already shared the high civilization of the Slann, serving as technicians and helpmates. As a result, their history has been one of slow degeneration under the shadow of the Slann's heritage, preserving many of the higher sciences lost to the Slann themselves.

The constant consumption of the narcotic koka in their diet enables them to live largley without sleep or food - so they tend to be a bit thin and slightly insane looking.Deprived of normal sensory functions they can overcome great
Pain, and have little aversion to blood, slaughter or death.

## Amazons special rules


**Blades of the ancients** : The Amazons carry a special kind of weapon of unknown origin, wich they call the Blades of the Ancients. These weapons are rumoured to be rare and mush sought after High Age artefacts. Despite their vast age they are still powerful, the gems set within them said blaze with the captures fires of a falling star.

The blades give the amazons +1 Strength in close combat. Furthermore, they projects a shield or arcane energy around the wearer, granting her a 6+ Ward save.

In addition the Amazons can point the baldes at the enemy and unleash the very flames of the sun itself in the shooting phase. This grants each Amazon a missile attack with a range of 12'' wich causes a Strength 3 hit, No penalities from range  or movement apply whene the amazons use this attack.

**skirmishers** : Amazons are well accustomed to jungle warfare and as such they are regarded as skirmishers. Should they required to rank un in order to fight in a melee. (Anakonda, Humming Bird,and Pirrana must be positioned in the front of rank)

**Native of Lustria** : The Amazons are native of Lustria and jungle hold no peril for them. When using the jungle rules (like WFB6 Warhamer Realms: Lustria ) they are immune to the same Encounters as the Lizardmen.
